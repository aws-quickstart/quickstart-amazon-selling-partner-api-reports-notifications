== Predeployment steps

=== Prepare your Seller Central account

You must have a Professional selling plan on https://sellercentral.amazon.com[Amazon Seller Central^] and https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/registering-as-a-developer[register^] as a developer to create SP-API applications.

Your SP-API application must be registered with an AWS IAM role. If you are using an AWS IAM user instead, sign in to https://sellercentral.amazon.com/[Amazon Seller Central^], and under *Partner Network* choose *Develop Apps*. Then choose **Edit App** and update the application to use an AWS IAM role.
