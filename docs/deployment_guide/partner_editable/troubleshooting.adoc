*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stackâ€™s state is retained, and the instance keeps running so that you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

'''
*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

'''
*Q.* Where do I find the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* to be used during the installation?

*A.* Sign in to https://sellercentral.amazon.com/[Amazon Seller Central^]. Under *Partner Network*, choose *Develop Apps*. Then, under *LWA credentials*, choose *View*.

'''
*Q.* Which values should I use for *Access Key* and *Secret Key* parameters during the installation?

*A.* You have to specify the AWS IAM user's Access Key and Secret Key values that you are currently using to assume role while signing your requests to SP-API.

'''
*Q.* Which value should I use for *Role Arn* parameter during the installation?

*A.* You have to specify the AWS IAM role ARN that is currently registered in your app. You can view this information by logging to https://sellercentral.amazon.com/[Seller Central^] and navigating to *Partner Network / Develop Apps*, and clicking on **Edit App**.

'''
*Q.* My application is currently registered with an AWS IAM user ARN instead of a role ARN, can I still use this Quick Start?

*A.* No. In order to use this Quick Start you have to update your application to use an AWS IAM role ARN instead. This is a best practice that increases the security of your application. You can update this information by logging to https://sellercentral.amazon.com/[Seller Central^] and navigating to *Partner Network / Develop Apps*, and clicking on **Edit App**.

'''
*Q.* Will I automatically start receiving notifications for report processing completion after installing this Quick Start?

*A.* No. In order to start receiving notifications you have to create the corresponding subscription by using the Amazon API Gateway *NotificationsSubscriberRestApi* endpoint. Subscriptions are specific to selling partners; this means that you have to call *NotificationsSubscriberRestApi* for each selling partner you want to onboard to this Quick Start.

'''
*Q.* Is it mandatory to store selling partners refresh tokens using the Amazon API Gateway *TokenStorageRestApi* endpoint provided in this Quick Start?

*A.* Yes. The AWS Step Functions workflow that is triggered when a report processing completion notification is received communicates to SP-API asynchronously and signs the corresponding requests with the selling partner's refresh token. For this reason, the refresh tokens have to be stored before.
