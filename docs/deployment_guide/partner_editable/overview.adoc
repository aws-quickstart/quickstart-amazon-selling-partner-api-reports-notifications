This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for users who want to automate reports generation in the Selling Partner API (SP-API) following security and architecture best practices. It includes an end-to-end, event-driven solution for creating, retrieving and storing reports. It also enables generic functionality for credential storage and SP-API notifications subscription and processing.
// Briefly describe the software. Use consistent and clear branding. 
// Include the benefits of using the software on AWS, and provide details on usage scenarios.

The https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/reports-api-v2021-06-30-use-case-guide[SP-API Reports section^] enables Amazon selling partners to get reports that help them manage their selling buisiness. It includes a wide variety of report types, covering use cases such as inventory and order management, taxes and invoicing. The https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/notifications-api-v1-use-case-guide[SP-API Notifications section^] provides the ability to build an event-driven architecture that notifies the selling partner about relevant changes in their buisiness, such as order and shipment status changes, promotions activation and report processing completion.
This Quick Start deploys on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud a serverless architecture based on AWS Lambda that automates SP-API reports creation, retrieval and storage. It leverages the notification mechanism by using Amazon SQS to build a performant, cost-optimized solution. It includes SP-API application secrets storage in AWS Secrets Manager, client token encryption with AWS KMS and supporting Amazon DynamoDB tables. It also includes an adaptable AWS Step Functions state machine that processes generated SP-API reports and notifies completion using an Amazon SNS topic, and an Amazon S3 bucket for report documents storage. Finally, all this functionality is exposed via Amazon API Gateway endpoints secured by AWS IAM, to be used from any product or service.
